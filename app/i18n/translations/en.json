Layer-2 networks (like Optimism) are not separate blockchains. Instead, they combine large quantities of transactions off-chain before submitting them bundled together on-chain, thus relying upon the same security and consensus mechanism as Ethereum.",

      "polygon": "Polygon is a distinct and separate blockchain that is compatible with Ethereum. It uses a different consensus mechanism than Ethereum and has its own security measures. Polygon is also known for lower transaction fees and faster transaction processing.\n\nPolygon is Ethereum compatible so your wallet address on Ethereum is the same as on Polygon.",
      "avalanche": "Avalanche is a stand-alone blockchain aiming to provide an alternative to the high costs and low speeds. Avalanche uses a proprietary consensus mechanism to increase transaction throughput and minimize energy consumption by validators.\n\nAvalanche is Ethereum compatible so your wallet address on Ethereum is the same as on Avalanche.",

BSC has a different consensus mechanism and network parameters that allow it to have lower transaction costs and faster processing time.\n\nBSC is Ethereum compatible so your wallet address on Ethereum is the same as on BSC."
